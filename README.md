# Agrowise

Agrowise is an innovative project aimed at leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to optimize agricultural yields. By analyzing specific soil conditions and climate variables, our AI provides personalized crop recommendations to farmers. Our goal is to enhance sustainable farming practices and increase productivity for a better future.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze soil and climate data.
- **Personalized Crop Suggestions**: Get crop recommendations tailored to your specific soil conditions.
- **Sustainable Farming**: Promote sustainable farming practices through data-driven decisions.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the backend API.
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing machine learning models and data analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- Required Node.js packages (listed in `package.json`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
